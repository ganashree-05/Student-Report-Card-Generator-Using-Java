# Student Report Card PDF Generator 📄🎓

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Report Card PDF Generator** is a **Java console-based application** that allows users to manage student academic records and generate a **professional PDF report card** using the **iText PDF library**.

The application enables adding student details, entering subject-wise marks, automatically calculating averages, grades, and remarks, and exporting the complete report in a structured PDF format.

This project demonstrates strong **C++/Java role–relevant concepts** such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **data structures**, **menu-driven logic**, and **file handling**.
